> This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.</br>
You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works.

### ‚ô¶Ô∏è  Topic
  - #### OSI model ?</br>
  OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO ‚Äì ‚ÄòInternational Organization for Standardization‚Äò, in the year 1984. It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.
  - #### TCP/IP addressing ?</br>
  TCP/IP includes an Internet addressing scheme that allows users and applications to identify a specific network or host to communicate with. An Internet address works like a postal address, allowing data to be routed to the chosen destination. TCP/IP provides standards for assigning addresses to networks, subnetworks, hosts, and sockets, and for using special addresses for broadcasts and local loopback.
  - #### IP Subnetting ?</br>
  A subnet is a division of an IP network (internet protocol suite), where an IP network is a set of communications protocols used on the Internet and other similar networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
