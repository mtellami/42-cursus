### 🔥2D Game🔥
</div>

> This project is a very small 2D game.
Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements, so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

### ♦️  Topic
  - #### What is MinilibX ?</br>
  MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window. It provides so-called simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system.
  - #### Backtracking algorithms ?</br>
 Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

### ♦️  Mandatory
  - 🔹 Check map validation (Extention, Content, Shape, Path).
  - 🔹 Initialize mlx, open window and put xpm textures, mlx_loop.
  - 🔹 Event handling (Hook) & hook_loop.
  - ❗ You need 2 work with structs cuz MinilibX functions take single void pointer.

### ♦️  Bonus
  - 🔹 Enemy patrol (hook 4 mlx_loop).
  - 🔹 Sprite animation (switching textures path).
  - 🔹 On screen counter (mlx_string_put).
